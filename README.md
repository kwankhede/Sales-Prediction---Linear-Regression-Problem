# Sales-Prediction---Linear-Regression-Problem


### Data Source
We will utilize the advertising dataset provided in https://www.kaggle.com/code/ashydv/sales-prediction-simple-linear-regression/notebook  to investigate the correlation between 'TV advertising' and 'sales' through the implementation of a basic linear regression model.


Within this Jupyter notebook, we will develop a linear regression model to forecast Sales by selecting a suitable predictor variable.
